Along the way you will pass the enigmatic \"Candelabra\" - a famous geoglyph with a mysterious past.

You will enjoy front row VIP seating (2 seats for one person) so you will have ample space for camera bags and you won't have to tolerate other passengers breathing down your neck while you view this spectacular marvel of nature.On return from the islands there should be time to relax on the sea-side promenade for lunch before setting off to the nearby airport with your driver. You will board a Cessna Caravan that holds 12 persons with wide seating and large windows. We work with only the best airlines operating the latest planes and with expert staff for your safety. Your flight will last 95 minutes and enroute to the Nasca lines you will also see the lush green valleys of Ica and the vast mountainous sand dunes of Huacachina.
