The global boom in commodities has come to this: before guano, bird dung was the center of an imperialist confrontation at sea in the nineteenth century, and is once again in strong demand.",

"We are excavating some of the last remaining guano in Peru" , explains Victor Rop\xF3n, 66, foreman of the province of Ancash, whose leathery skin reflects his years working on the guano islands, since 17 years old.']

It\'s a small miracle that the islands still have guano reserves, thanks to a century\'s effort praised by biologists as a rare example of sustainable exploitation of the resource. As the debate over whether global oil production has peaked continues, the story of guano could offer a parable, with maritime treachery, development of synthetic alternatives in Europe and in the desperate effort to avoid deposits when they were exhausted.']

"Guano is a highly desirable business". It\'s also an undeniably grueling undertaking from the perspective of workers who migrate annually to the island to collect it. Day laborers rise before dawn to dig the hardened guano with shovels and hoes.']

"It\'s not an easy life, but I chose it" says Bruno Sulca, 62, supervising the loading of bags of Gua\xF1ape guano from the island off the north coast of Peru. Sulca and other workers earn about 400 euros per month, more than triple what they pay manual workers in impoverished mountainous areas.']

It is unlikely to ever boom again as compared to the nineteenth century, when deposits were 50 feet thick and export earnings accounted for most of the national budget. On most islands, including Asia, located south of the capital, Lima, guano reaches less than 30 inches. But that which remains here is coveted when viewed in the context of the frenzy in Peru and abroad caused by synthetic fertilizers like urea, whose price has doubled in the last year.', '\u201CGuano has the advantage of being free from artificial chemicals\u201D , explains Enrique Balmaceda, producer of organic mangoes in Piura, a northern province of Peru.

Since then, the Government of Peru restricts harvesting to about two islands per year to allow droppings to accumulate.', 'Guano administrators maintain armed guards on each of the islands, to protect the birds. \u201CFishermen are the most damaging\u201D said Romulo Ibarra, 40, one of the two guards stationed on the uninhabited island Asia. \u201CWhen you approach the island, the motors scare guanays\u201D he says, referring to precious guanay cormorant. \u201CAnd at sea, fishing boats catch anchoveta, something we can not control.\u201D Anchoveta is a 15 centimeter fish belonging to the anchovy family and is the main food of seabirds who leave their droppings in these arid islands.']

Though in the past two years the population of birds has increased from 3.2 to 4 million, it is still a negligible figure compared to the once 60 million population during the height of the first guano rush. Faced with a decline in anchoveta stock, managers from Proabonos have frozen guano exports to ensure a domestic supply.']
