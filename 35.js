Since that day in 1911 Bingham dedicated his life to rescue Machu Picchu from the dense forest that had been actively reclaiming it for hundreds of years.  Coming from a family of explorers Bingham had long heard of the fabled lost city of the Incas and was ecstatic to show his find to the world in all its glory.']
