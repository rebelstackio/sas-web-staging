           For those with a keen interest in archeology and adventure, the tour embarks from Lima via the Ruta del Sol (just around 2 hours) enroute to discover the Norte Central civilization.
Also known as Caral or Caral-Supe, the Norte Central civilization was a complex Pre-Columbian society that spanned nearly 30 major population centers in what is now known as the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru.
The oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of six sites where civilization separately originated in the ancient world, Caral flourished between 3000 BC and 1800 BC. It's derivative name, Caral-Supe, is born from Caral in the Supe Valley, a large and significantly studied site in Norte Chico. Complex society in Norte Chico emerged just a millennium after Sumer in Mesopotamia, around the same time as the pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Norte Chico predates the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.`,
