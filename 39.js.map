Unless you chartered your own private flight from Lima, public access was limited to mostly car or bus which is very long (7-8 hour one-way) trip from Lima.\n\t\t“The common sentiment related to us by visitors to Nasca Lines has been one of frustration that so much time is wasted travelling to experience a tour that lasts less than an hour” explains Lucio - a veteran Peru guide of more than 20 years.\n\t\tWhile the enigma that is the Nasca Lines is so very powerful, for travellers it comes down to the reality of how they want to spend their precious vacation time - enjoying that time replete with wonders and activities or crammed into buses for long durations.\n\t\tThankfully the enigmatic Nasca Lines are now available to those on limited time. Lucio continues, “flying from Pisco's new airport is so much easier.

Lucio suggests the only source of knowledge is cultural: “We don't know much about pre-inca history because it is not recorded in written language but rather with icons in various forms”.`,\n\t\t\t\t`Our quest for answers to the mystery of Avenida de los Hoyos begins with an expedition to the site. We set out from Paracas, passing Pisco, then another thirty minutes drive past Humay to Tambo Colorado where, Lucio explains, there is another archaelogical site that may help us uncover the meaning and intent of the strange geoglyphs nearby at Monte Sierpe.

But for reasons that remain unclear, the influence of the Chavín declined as new civilizations sprang forth.`,\n\t\t\t\t`“Human survival and success demands that we seek greener pastures. Even today we see peoples in depressed areas migrating to lands where there is greater prosperity and the chance of greater success\". Lucio's analogy explains the apparent disintegration of the Chavín culture as the Paracas culture came into being.`,\n\t\t\t\t`“While they started out as humble fishermen, the Paracenses later on became great farmers during a period when their lands were fertile and humid. They would dig great canals in locations where the water table was high, just deep enough so that the roots of plants could reach water. During their reign they discovered cotton and textiles and forged trading routes with the highland peoples near them who were also learning to domesticate Vicuña whose fur could also be used in textile making”.`\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\turl_image: 'images/articles/cantalloc_2_t.jpg',\n\t\t\timage_class: 'image-horizontal',\n\t\t\tparragraphs: [\n\t\t\t\t`As the Chavín culture gave way to the Paracas culture, so too did Paracas give way to Nazca culture which perfected irrigation and water management for farming. They built great aqueducts that moved water in vast quantities from the river valley to the surrounding plains (probably in response to drought) and they perfected textile craftsmanship and pottery-making. But this great civilization was destined for a great suffering - a climate shift appears to have run the rivers dry.`\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\turl_image: 'images/articles/nazca_mono_portrait.jpg',\n\t\t\timage_class: 'image-vertical',\n\t\t\tblockquote: `“Nanazca is a word in Quechua which means pain or suffering”`,\n\t\t\tparragraphs: [\n\t\t\t\t`“Nanazca is a word in Quechua which means pain or suffering. It seems certain this period, the area, and the civilization itself [Nazca] was later named after this great decline”. Lucio's insights into cultural history help us understand their urgency for water and their inclination to appeal to their gods for help. Estimates of the building of the Nazca aqueducts occur during the third or fourth phase of their culture. It seems likely their construction were in response to a great drought.`,\n\t\t\t\t`“I believe that the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe was created during the drought that ended the Nazca civilization - clearly there is the motive. And if we study the shape of the figure we can see strong commonalities with other representations of Q'hoa - the concentric circles representing water or rain, the long body terminating in a head with mouth agape”. Lucio's explanation has convinced us and although the details of the serpent's head are far to weathered to make out the signature feline head found in other representations, the long body and concentric circles are Q'hoa's trademark.`,\n\t\t\t\t`But significance of the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe, as Lucio explains, does not end there: “This geoglyph may be proof that the Nazca civilization believed it could speak and appeal to the heavens using great marks on the earth”. Like castaways on a deserted island forming 'S.0.S.' on the beach to signal passing planes, it is feasible to think that these early cultures might have believed it possible to communicate with the heavens and clouds (their gods) through geoglyphs. And if this notion is acceptable, then the geoglyphs at Nazca may have been part of the same appeal.`,\n\t\t\t\t`“While the Nazca lines and other various geoglyphs in the surrounding region do not necessarily represent Q'hoa, they do certainly represent animals, humans, and life - what might be appeals to the gods to bring rain to bring life to the land. If we consider Kaufman Doig, then the Nazca monkey is also a representation of Q'hoa”.`\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./app/data/articles/full-articles/article.2.en.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
