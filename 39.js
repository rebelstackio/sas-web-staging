	description: 'The Avenida de los Hoyos, a geoglyph like the Nazca lines consisting of a series of large basin-like potholes along a mountain ridge, appears to slither up the slope for miles.',
	content: 'Getting to Nasca to see the Nasca lines once used to be a complicated and time-consuming effort. Unless you chartered your own private flight from Lima, public access was limited to mostly car or bus which is very long (7-8 hour one-way) trip from Lima.\n\t\t\u201CThe common sentiment related to us by visitors to Nasca Lines has been one of frustration that so much time is wasted travelling to experience a tour that lasts less than an hour\u201D explains Lucio - a veteran Peru guide of more than 20 years.\n\t\tWhile the enigma that is the Nasca Lines is so very powerful, for travellers it comes down to the reality of how they want to spend their precious vacation time - enjoying that time replete with wonders and activities or crammed into buses for long durations.\n\t\tThankfully the enigmatic Nasca Lines are now available to those on limited time. Lucio continues, \u201Cflying from Pisco\'s new airport is so much easier. The airport is a 5 minute drive from Paracas or a 20 minute flight from Lima - you save a whole day of traveling that you can use to enjoy all the other great things that Paracas has to offer.\u201D',

Lucio suggests the only source of knowledge is cultural: \u201CWe don\'t know much about pre-inca history because it is not recorded in written language but rather with icons in various forms\u201D.', 'Our quest for answers to the mystery of Avenida de los Hoyos begins with an expedition to the site. We set out from Paracas, passing Pisco, then another thirty minutes drive past Humay to Tambo Colorado where, Lucio explains, there is another archaelogical site that may help us uncover the meaning and intent of the strange geoglyphs nearby at Monte Sierpe. The drive following the Pisco River is beautiful - a green valley with a contrasting desert mountain backdrop.']

While artifacts and burials from the Inca period have been found in the tombs themselves, Lucio feels that the tombs are likely pre-inca and likely thousands of years old.']

We hope to discover it\'s true name or offer another with respect to the original creators\' intent. Otherwise we can settle with Avenida de los Hoyos\u201D.', 'We find two large rock-lined excavations, similar to those at Tambo Colorado, at the base of the geoglyph. They are still littered with human remains, skulls and bones mostly. The \'tombs\' are crudely constructed similar to those we have seen in Tambo Colorado and we are inclined to accept Lucio\'s conclusion that they are likely pre-Inca as the style of construction resembles nothing of the fine stonework during the Inca period.']

We press on along a ridge between two valleys following these strange holes, every once-in-a-while stopping to observe their construction.

For that, Lucio informs us, we must hike the summit. Although the incline changes dramatically, the rocks seem to make easy steps and we hit the top thirsty but in great spirits.']

Many deserts, especially the Atacama, are able to lock in their mineral wealth due to extreme aridity and with rain become highly fertile for farming. And while our modern climate science has unraveled the workings of smaller climate cycles such as the El Ni\xF1o oscillation, the longer climate cycles are beyond our history of climate record-keeping. It appears that areas in Peru may have been fertile for hundreds of years, then suffered drought for hundreds of years after.']

San Pedro is a hallucinegic cactus that, no doubt, the Chav\xEDn used to convince their neighboring cultures in the existence of their deities.

Even today we see peoples in depressed areas migrating to lands where there is greater prosperity and the chance of greater success". Lucio\'s analogy explains the apparent disintegration of the Chav\xEDn culture as the Paracas culture came into being.', '\u201CWhile they started out as humble fishermen, the Paracenses later on became great farmers during a period when their lands were fertile and humid. They would dig great canals in locations where the water table was high, just deep enough so that the roots of plants could reach water. During their reign they discovered cotton and textiles and forged trading routes with the highland peoples near them who were also learning to domesticate Vicu\xF1a whose fur could also be used in textile making\u201D.']

They built great aqueducts that moved water in vast quantities from the river valley to the surrounding plains (probably in response to drought) and they perfected textile craftsmanship and pottery-making. But this great civilization was destined for a great suffering - a climate shift appears to have run the rivers dry.']

It seems certain this period, the area, and the civilization itself [Nazca] was later named after this great decline\u201D. Lucio\'s insights into cultural history help us understand their urgency for water and their inclination to appeal to their gods for help. Estimates of the building of the Nazca aqueducts occur during the third or fourth phase of their culture. It seems likely their construction were in response to a great drought.', '\u201CI believe that the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe was created during the drought that ended the Nazca civilization - clearly there is the motive. And if we study the shape of the figure we can see strong commonalities with other representations of Q\'hoa - the concentric circles representing water or rain, the long body terminating in a head with mouth agape\u201D. Lucio\'s explanation has convinced us and although the details of the serpent\'s head are far to weathered to make out the signature feline head found in other representations, the long body and concentric circles are Q\'hoa\'s trademark.', 'But significance of the geoglyph at Monte Sierpe, as Lucio explains, does not end there: \u201CThis geoglyph may be proof that the Nazca civilization believed it could speak and appeal to the heavens using great marks on the earth\u201D. Like castaways on a deserted island forming \'S.0.S.\' on the beach to signal passing planes, it is feasible to think that these early cultures might have believed it possible to communicate with the heavens and clouds (their gods) through geoglyphs. And if this notion is acceptable, then the geoglyphs at Nazca may have been part of the same appeal.', '\u201CWhile the Nazca lines and other various geoglyphs in the surrounding region do not necessarily represent Q\'hoa, they do certainly represent animals, humans, and life - what might be appeals to the gods to bring rain to bring life to the land. If we consider Kaufman Doig, then the Nazca monkey is also a representation of Q\'hoa\u201D.']
