Do not hesitate to try the exquisite local food before you visit the Center for traditional textiles in cusco, a local organization committed to preserving the region's weaving traditions (If visiting the Sacred Valley on Sunday, you will visit their center in Chinchero instead).`

You may also hike to the inspiring ruins of Pisac or take a short walk through the countryside to the seldom-visited town of Maras, where pre-Columbian salt mines still operate today. Visit the Inca agricultural terraces of Moray, thought to have been a nursery to experiment with and modify different varieties of crops.

The town is still laid out as it was during the Incan empire, allowing its visitors to glimpse the history which still exists within its boundaries.
            
            Board the train and follow the Urubamba River as it tumbles its way towards the Amazon and the sacred city of Machu Picchu, Peru. Tour ancient canals that still bring water from the high mountains to the baths used by Inca priests. As visitors, you are welcomed to respectfully dip your hands in the cool water. After your guided tour of Machu Picchu, you'll return to the village of Aguas Calientes (located at the base of Machu Picchu). Enjoy one of many excellent local restaurants or end your day soaking in the hot springs after exploring one of the most magical archaeological sites in the world.
