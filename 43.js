	description: 'Machu Picchu, also known as Pata Llacta the lost city of the Incas, is one of the earth\u2019s ancient megastructures of great historical value.  Most recently it has been recognized as one of the seven wonders of the modern world.\n\t\tThis impressing archaeological site has been steadily growing in popularity and currently receives over 2500 tourists daily.  Veteran guide Lucio explains that \u201Cdue to increasing demand, the areas accessible to visitors are reduced and increasingly restricted every year.\u201D  Today the visitors are still able to go inside and touch most the ancient structures of Machu Picchu allowing for a very intimate and personal experience.  In coming years the tours will be restricted to fenced-off pathways and single file lines.',
